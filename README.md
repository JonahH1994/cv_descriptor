# cv_descriptor

This project was a part of my Computer Vision course at Cornell. Its purpose was to understand how certain CV functions work. As such, I implemented a few functions that can be found in the OpenCV library such as:

  1. Harris Corner Detector
  2. SIFT
  3. Feature Matching using SSD or a ratio test
  4. Find Fundamental Matrix
  5. 3D Point Triangulation
  6. RANSAC
  
To run the functions, use the runner python notebook. Alternatively, you can create your own runner file that calls the functions python scripts.
